+ inputs and it maybe done using : **keyboards , mouse , microphone , camera ..** 
+ storing the information 
+ processing the inputs using **ALGORITHM** which is a series of commands 
+ results 
 # what about the hardware ? 
 everything in our machines work as **Ones** and **Zeroes** , each wire is such a 01 and so on 
  it can change **Decimal Number system** to a **Binary Number system** 
  and each Alphabit would be presented by numbers like **A** is **00001** and so on 
  **pictures are presented by pixels**  as well as **sounds as Waves** .
