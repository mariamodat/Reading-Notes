# Copmarison Operators and Loops 
## comparison operators are used to *Evaluate* Conditions 
![operators](https://techvidvan.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/12/python-comparison-operators.jpg)

such as :
|operator| role of it|
|:-------|:----------|
| == | is it equal |
| != | not equal | 
| === | used to compare both data **Type** and **Value** are the same |
| !== | used to compare both data **Type** and **Value** are *NOT* the same|
| >= | greater than or equal |
| <= | less than or equal | 

## the stucture of Comparison operations be like :
 (    ( score > = pass        ) && (    2 > = 3  )     )
  
|structure | name of it | 
|:---------|:-----------|
| score | operand | 
| >= | operator | 
| pass | operand | 
| && | logical operator |
| (  ) | enclosing brackets |
| (score >= pass) | expression |

# Loops 
## why we use it ? 
**to check the condition if returns T the loop block will run until it returns F which means *End* of the loop** 

|Type of loop | Role |
|:------------|:-----|
| For | Makes the loop run for a specific time |
| While | the code will run into a loop for as long as the condition is T |
| Do while | it will run for at least once even if the condition evaluates to F |

## lets get started with For loop structure :
 Ex : for ( var i =0  ; i < 10 ; i ++  )
 1. var i = 0 : create the Value and start it with 0 
 2. i < 10 : the condition 
 3. i++ : the counter 

  this loop will run until it returns into F then it will end the loop .
**this loop will run for 10 times**  once the value of i is 10 then it returns to F an the script moves to the next line of the code.
