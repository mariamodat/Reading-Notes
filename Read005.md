# About JavaScript 
## what is JavaScript ? 
**JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive.**
### it is also written in plain text, just like HTML and CSS, so you do not need any new tools to write a script.

# what is the function of JavaScript ?
 1. **The JavaScript is added last and enhances the *usability* of the page or the experience of *interacting* with the site** . 
 2. **Keeping it separate means that the page still works if the user cannot load or run the JavaScript. You can also reuse the code on several pages (making the site *faster* to load and *easier* to maintain).**
